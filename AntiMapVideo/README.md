## About AntiMap Video##
AntiMap Video is a desktop application built in Openframeworks. It synchronises recorded data from the AntiMap Log mobile application with raw video footage (mov, avi, mp4, m4v). It was originally created as a snowboarding/skiing application to visualize real time rider data and stats similar to a video game. 

AntiMap Video (version 0.1) is still an early prototype with plenty of kinks to work out before a 1.0 can be released. You can download the current working prototype application here (OSX only). Source code, and a windows version is not yet available but is definitely on the TODO list.

Includes:
- Sample data from AntiMap Log mobile application- "DATA_SAMPLE.csv".
- Sample video- "VIDEO_SAMPLE.mp4" (this is a compressed version of the original GoPro HD video which was 4 minutes long and 380mb, it is now 45 seconds and 10mb).

Important:
I purposely set the included video sample to be 1.5 seconds ahead of the data. Once you drag and drop both files onto the application you can adjust the individual timelines or the 'Video/Data time offset' to equal -1.5 seconds. Then everything will be in sync.

Further installation/setup instructions to come.
