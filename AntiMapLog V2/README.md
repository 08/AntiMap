## AntiMap Log V2##
AntiMap Log V2 is a work in progress. Currently added Core Motion framework to allow logging of accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. Stats are all logging, but not displayed on screen yet. Will probably need to redesign UI to accomodate all the new data.

## New addons##
 - ofxCoreMotion- https://github.com/trentbrooks/ofxCoreMotion
 - ofxTouchGUI- https://github.com/trentbrooks/ofxTouchGUI (also requires ofxXmlSettings & ofxOsc)
 - The rest of the addons are now just in the src/extras folder

## To dos##
 - Redesign UI to display the new sensor data
 - Add settings screen with the ofxTouchGUI
 - Add dropbox support ofxDropBox- https://github.com/trentbrooks/ofxDropBox
